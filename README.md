Repository made to create/develop a _Store Management System for Perú_. I will develop a the store management system using the MERN tech stack connecting the data to my API and then from there, storing the data into MongoDB. This app is built using _**npm create vite@latest**_ for the frontend. The new tech stack is designed for simplicity, performance, and ease of content management for future development and maintenance.
